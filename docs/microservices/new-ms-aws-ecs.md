# Creating a new Toto Microservice on AWS (ECS)
[Go back to the Main Page](../../README.md) <br>

This section goes through what it takes to create a new Toto Microservice and deploy it on AWS.

## 1. Toto AWS Architecture

Before continuing, make sure that you understand well how Toto runs on AWS. <br>
For that, check the AWS Toto Architecture resources: 
* [Toto AWS Architecture based on ECS]()

## 2. Creating and Deploying a new Microservice

Before reading this guide, make sure you have a good understanding of how Toto AWS Infrastructure is managed. **[Check the Toto AWS Infrastructure and CI/CD Guide](./aws.md)** first.

In general, creating and deploying a new Microservice in Toto, requires the following steps, which we will go through: 
1. Create a Github Repo for the Microservice and the Terraform Workspaces.
2. Update Toto's AWS Terraform ([Core Infrastructure Flow, as described here](../infra-cicd/aws/aws.md#11-core-infrastructure-flow)) to create the needed Github Action secrets. 
3. Create the Microservices Terraform configuration files
4. Create the Microservices Github Actions Workflows
5. Push

### 2.1. Creating a Github Repo 
Toto follows the pattern *One-repo per Micrservice*. That means that you need to create a new Repository when you want to create a new Microservice.<br>
The Repository must be **a Github** Repository and **must be created by hand**. 

### 2.2. Checking out the Template Project 
The next step, is to check-out (*clone*) the Github Toto Microservice Template project, for the Programming Language that you need. Here are the repos: 
* [Python Microservice]()
* [NodeJS Microservice]()

Once you have clone the Repo, detach it from the template repository, and attach it to the new Repo that you created on the previous step.

### 2.3. Update the Github Repo with Environment Secrets
As explained in the [Toto AWS Infrastructure Guide](../infra-cicd/aws/aws.md), the [CI/CD Microservice Flow] does two things: 
* It builds the Microservice and deploys the Container Image on ECR.
* It triggers a Terraform *Plan* and *Apply*, updating the AWS Infrastructure to create the Microservice-specific infrastructure components (e.g. ECS Task Definition, ECS Service, ALB Listener Rule).

To be able to update the AWS Infrastructure, though, the build needs some information. That information will be ARNs and IDs of the common Infrastructure components, such as the Load Balancer reference (to be able to add a Listener Rule), the Subnet references (to be able to create the ECS Service), the IAM roles to use as Task Role and Task Execution Role, etc.

> All these variables are expected to be provided **as Environment Secrets** by Github Actions.

> To set those variables, in the [`toto-aws-terra` Terraform Configuration files](https://github.com/nicolasances/toto-aws-terra), you will need to create a **new Terraform configuration file** for this new Microservice.

This new file's naming convention is `repo-<microservice name>.tf` (e.g. `repo-toto-ms-expenses.tf`). <br>
This file will contain all the `github_actions_environment_secret` resources that will create the Environment Secrets on the github repo. <br>

> A template for this file is present in the Microservice Template Project.<br>
The name of that file is `repo-toto-ms-template.tf`. 

You will need to **copy** (or move) that file to the `toto-aws-terra` project, changing the name of the repo and when pushing that project, Terraform will update your Microservice's Github Repo with the new secrets **for the given environment**.

### 2.4. Update the Microservice Terraform configuration files
Make sure that all files under the `./terraform` folder are updated with the right Microservice name (there should only be one file to check, the `terraform/locals.tf` file that contains the Microservice name).

### 2.5. Commit and Push
Just commit and push and watch the magic (hopefully) happen! :)
