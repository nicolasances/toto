# Welcome to Toto!
This repo mostly serves as a **documentation repo**, providing guides for Toto and the description of some of the core (or more complex) processes.

This page is an **Index** for all documentation related to Toto. 

## Toto Cross-cloud Architecture

Toto Microservices can be **deployed both on GCP and AWS**. <br>

Since Toto runs across multiple Cloud Providers, some considerations and choices were made. These considerations are all documented in the following pages: 

* [Cross-Cloud Architecture Considerations & Choices](./docs/cross-cloud/considerations.md)

## Toto Services and Apps 

Service and App-specific documentation can be found in the repository of the Service or App.<br>
