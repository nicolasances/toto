# Welcome to Toto!

> This is a documentation repository. No code stored here ;) 

Toto is an Ecosystem of Apps that go from Personal Finances Management to Personal Trainer apps. <br> 
The Ecosystem also consists in a set of SDKs and frameworks to do anything, from exposing APIs, to building and orchestrating AI Agents. 

## Index
So where do we start? 

* **Building Microservices in Toto** - The following resources are useful to start building Microservices following the (very opinionated) Toto approach: 
    * [Toto Microservice SDK](https://github.com/nicolasances/toto-microservice-sdk) - Repository of the Python and Node SDKs that can be used to build and deploy Microservices across different Clouds (e.g. AWS and GCP)
    * [Toto Node Microservice Template](https://github.com/nicolasances/toto-node-template) - Best way to quickly boostrap a Toto Microservice in **Node**
    * [Toto Python Microservice Template](https://github.com/nicolasances/toto-python-ms-template) - Best way to quickly boostrap a Toto Microservice in **Python**
 
* **MCP Servers** - Creating MCP Servers and integrating them in the Toto Ecosystem:
   * [Python MCP Server using FastMCP](https://github.com/nicolasances/py-playground-mcp) - A Repo that shows how to create an MCP Server that exposes a Toto Microservice
   * Note that the [Toto Microservice SDK](https://github.com/nicolasances/toto-microservice-sdk) supports creating MCP Servers directly in a Toto Microservice. 
 
## Playgrounds
The following projects and repos contain playgrounds or working demos of some of the concepts and applications in the Toto ecosystem. 

- [Agentic Playground (NodeJS)](https://github.com/nicolasances/node-playground-agentic) - Shows how to create an MCP Client to use tools exposed by a remote MCP Server in Node.  

## Examples
These are some examples that can be used to see how Toto Microservices work:
